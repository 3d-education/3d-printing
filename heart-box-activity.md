2. Make a heart:

- Resize the heart so that its length and width are both **80mm** by dragging the white square handles on the base and top of the heart (or by clicking on one of the white square handles and entering “**80**” in the fields). 
- Change the height of the heart to **30mm** by clicking on the handle in the middle of the heart.

7. **OPTIONAL**: Place text on the inside of the lid.  <img src="images/tinkercad-box-12.png" style="float:right;width:220px" alt="editing menu"> 
- Grab a **Text** from the **Basic Shapes** panel on the right and drag it onto the workplane.
- Write whatever is to be written on the inside of the box in the **Text** field. 
- Change the Bevel to approximately **1**. This makes the text thicker and therefore easier to 3D print.
- Resize the length and width to be small enough to fit on the inside of the lid. <img src="images/tinkercad-box-13.png" style="float:right;width:200px" alt="heart box lid with writing">
