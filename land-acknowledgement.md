# Land acknowledgement

We acknowledge the indigenous lands where we are located.    

We acknowledge and respect the lək̓ʷəŋən peoples on whose traditional territory the university stands and the Songhees, Esquimalt and W̱SÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.

Visit [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/) to explore the indigenous territories, languages, and treaties in your area.

Also visit the [First Peoples Principles of Leaning](https://www.fnesc.ca/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FNESC-Learning-First-Peoples-poster-11x17-hi-res-v2.pdf) where the principles are as follows:
- Learning ultimately supports the well-being of the self, the family, the community, the land, the spirits, and the ancestors.
- Learning is holistic, reflexive, reflective, experiential, and relational (focused on connectedness, on reciprocal relationships, and a sense of place).
- Learning involves recognizing the consequences of one‘s actions.
- Learning involves generational roles and responsibilities.
- Learning recognizes the role of Indigenous knowledge.
- Learning is embedded in memory, history, and story.
- Learning involves patience and time.
- Learning requires exploration of one‘s identity.
- Learning involves recognizing that some knowledge is sacred and only shared with permission and/or in certain situations.

Our 3D Design and Print for Elementary Education outlines many of these principals including its reflective and experiential style as well as patience and time. Many 3D printing projects also involve one's identity, sacred knowledge adn memory history and story. As in my other work I work with a local nation to print some of their language letters for their schools and education programs.
