# Safety Considerations

**Recycling:** Upon our research, one limitation in regards to recylcing PLA and other 3D printing materials is the lack of affortable options and community availability. As such, more investement in these facilities and supporting the environment for 3D printing waste would be beneficial.

North Vancouver School District's Access 2 Innovate Program is located in North Vancouver, however it has expressed interest and willingness to support other school districts with this recycling venture. They are only able to recycle PLA fillament as of this time.

**Physical environment and room ventillation** are essential considerations, they require planning to find adequate air flow within your school and space to situate the printer and all of its tools. Conversations with students need to be continuously discussed to ensure safety during the printing process.

# Privacy Considerations

## Digital Privacy Policies
Please check your school district's privacy policy, consult the IT departement regarding student data storage and inquire about required consent forms for student usage of programs (if applicable). Please see [TinkerCad Privacy Policy](privacy policy - https://www.tinkercad.com/privacy){:target="_blank"}, their [FAQ's](https://www.tinkercad.com/privacy-faq){:target="_blank"}, and their [Children's Privacy Statement](https://www.tinkercad.com/childrens-privacy){:target="_blank"}. 

[Commons Sense Media](https://privacy.commonsense.org/privacy-report/Tinkercad){:target="_blank"} also has a privacy report on TinkerCad

**Design Creation and Gifs**
- In order to have an accessible resource, we decided to include animated Gifs to illustrate the previous written instructions. This visual clarity helps students who can't read follow the steps, when the teacher facilitates their own workshop and it allows teacher to easily follow along and see the process of the activities. One key limitation, could be people who are visually impaired, however the written instructions should compliment and be sufficient to complete the activities without the use of Gifs.
- Dictation: text to speech dictation is another accessible tool that most computers have access to and can help dictate the activities within Github.
- Our images include an ALT function to describe them for anyone seeking a written description.
